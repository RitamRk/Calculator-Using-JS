# CALCULATOR USING HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT

A calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great example of a simple yet functional web application. By combining these three technologies, developers can create an interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

HTML provides the structure and layout of the calculator interface. It allows you to define buttons, input fields, and other necessary elements to build the user interface of the calculator.

CSS comes into play to enhance the visual appearance of the calculator. It allows you to customize the colors, fonts, sizes, and overall styling of the calculator elements, giving it a polished and professional look.

JavaScript is the key component that adds functionality to the calculator. With JavaScript, you can handle button clicks, capture user input, perform calculations, and update the display accordingly. JavaScript enables you to implement the logic behind the calculator's operations, making it a fully operational tool for performing arithmetic calculations.
